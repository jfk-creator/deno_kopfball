This is an online multiplayer game written in TypeScript with p5 and Deno.

You can watch a live demo @ http://server.nanohack.de

The proof of concept is proven. 
It's a fun game, and the multiplayer aspect is working without any reconciliation.

You can run the project with /freunde -> npm run dev and /spielplatz -> deno server.ts --allow-net 
You will have to change the server address in /freunde/ts/types.ts
